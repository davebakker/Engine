## Engine
This project is the start of the personal journey to learn about (game) engines and (3D) graphics. It also offered me in-depth learning experience about the programming language C++.

The engine is created with the support of the [GLFW getting started guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html), the [Learn OpenGL guide](https://learnopengl.com/), and the videos from [Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject).

### Sources
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) (Graphics Library Framework) is a lightweight and multi-platform utility library used with the Open Graphics Library.
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library) is a cross-platform library that helps in querying and loading OpenGL extensions.
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (source control) is used to simplify the interaction with the Git repository and visualize the git-flow.
- [STB image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) (public domain image loader) is a single script used for image loading.
