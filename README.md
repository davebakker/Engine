## Engine
This engine is created with the support of the [GLFW getting started guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html), the [guides from Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/), and the videos from [Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject). This project is the start of my personal journey to learn about (game) engines, (3D) graphics, and the programming language C++.

### Sources
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) (Graphics Library Framework) is a lightweight and multi-platform utility library used with the Open Graphics Library.
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library) is a cross-platform library that helps in querying and loading OpenGL extensions.
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (source control) is used to simplify the interaction with the Git repository and visualize the git-flow.
